# Plans

## Prestiges
- Meltdown
- Other
- Kugelblitz

## Meltdown Mechanics
- Meltdown Upgrades
- Moderators
- Coolants
	- NaK: Turbine more effective - Reactor less effective
	- Sodium: Reactors more effective - Turbines less effective
	- FLiNaK: Efficiency increment improved - Chance to meltdown automatically (half corium)
	- FliBe: Corium gain increased based on efficiency - Cooling rods less effective
	- Lead: ???
	- Lead Bismuth: Centrifuges tetrate heat and steam gain - All other producers less effective
- Centrifuges
	- Unlocked after Lead Coolant along with Buy Max(Manual)

## Other Mechanics
- Nucleosynthesis


## Kugelblitz Mechanics
- Particle Acceleration
- Fusion Reactors
- Neutrino Capture
